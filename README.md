ndogen-client
===================

A viewer for a all-new ambitious [source documentation format](http://github.com/oliver----/ndogen). ;-)

Ndogen exposes documentation as data (JSON) instead of pre-rendered HTML. 
This approach not only saves some bytes at transmission, it also allows clients to individually render the result.

I'll start with a clean document output format, with some unobtrusive interaction (navigation, search, etc.).
